## Abstract

Meaning amplification through pattern interaction

This dissertation establishes **Semantic Resonance** as a formal conceptual framework within the Resonance Data and Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing (QIRC) paradigm.

---

## 1. Introduction

Modern artificial systems excel at processing information but struggle to:
- Model meaning as dynamic, temporal states
- Distinguish between information, insight, and wisdom
- Represent relevance through resonance rather than similarity

**Semantic Resonance** addresses these fundamental challenges.

---

## 2. Conceptual Framework

### 2.1 Definition

**Semantic Resonance** is defined as a conceptual construct within the Vega Continuum that:
- Operates on resonance-based principles
- Maintains temporal coherence
- Contributes to meaning stability

### 2.2 Core Properties

1. **Relational Meaning**: Context-dependent, not absolute
2. **Resonance Strength**: Relevance through interaction
3. **Temporal Persistence**: Stability over time
4. **Coherence**: Consistency across states

## 4. What This IS

- ✔ A conceptual framework
- ✔ A definitional contribution
- ✔ Part of the Vega Continuum
- ✔ VSP-compliant publication
- ✔ Prior art establishment

---

## 5. What This Is NOT

- ✘ New physical laws
- ✘ Quantum hardware requirements
- ✘ Consciousness or sentience claims
- ✘ Implementation specification
- ✘ Business or commercial product

---

## 6. Scientific Contribution

This work contributes:
1. Novel conceptual framing for **Semantic Resonance**
2. Clear definitional boundaries
3. Integration with existing VEGA concepts
4. Foundation for future research

---

## 7. Conclusion

**Semantic Resonance** represents a fundamental contribution to the understanding of resonance-based meaning systems. It establishes prior art while preserving implementation freedom.
